This package exists here because generating classes from FTL.jj produces classes with this package. These classes depends on other classes in the same package.
FTL.jj is slightly modified:
- White spaces are not SKIPped, but are TOKENs. White space token named as WHITESPACE.
- New token UNCLOSED_STRING_LITERAL.
- New lines are not eaten (eatNewline method is commented).
ParseException.java
TokenMgrError.java 

are taken from FreeMarker sources, because they are modified by authors of FreeMarker. https://github.com/freemarker/freemarker/blob/v2.3.22/build.xml

#SimpleCharStream.java - commented out modification of column number by tabulator character
Other files are generated by JavaCC version 6.1.2 just like in FreeMarker. https://github.com/freemarker/freemarker/blob/v2.3.22/ivy.xml
